## Overview
The below analysus has been perfomred on infromatin from the New York city bike sharing program to determine if this program could be sucessfull in other cities specifically Des Moines.

## Results


#### Checkout Time for Users

The below shows, by nuber of trips, how long each trip lasts. Majority of trips taken are less than one hour with the largest concertration around ~30 minutes. Longer trips are less popular in general with these bikes.

When breaking out the same data as above across male,female, and unknown genders, the same overall trend reigns true, shorter trips are more popular.  It is shown that males use the service more, but both males and females who use the service us it in a similar fashion.

The below graphic details the time of day when riding is more popular. There are high concerntrations around 6am-9am along with 5pm-7pm which aligns well with the average work day "rush hours"

Breaking the same graphic above out by gender shows again that males are using this service more frequently than females.  the same trend exists for using the bikes around rush hour times.

When breaking down trips by subscribers or not, the same trend follows suit with males using the service more often than females.  There is a consistent dip in usage on Wednesdays and Weekends compared to the other days of the week.

When looking at starting locations, they are spread out across the city with some areas more popular than others but those popular areas are fairly spread out across the city

The same can be said for ending locations detailed below.

## Summary

Overall we can see that the citibikes are very popular in New York perdominatley for men. Thes bikes when being used are used mostly during the rush hour commute suggesting they are used as a means of getting to work. It is also noted by looking at the starting and ending locations however that not all New Yorkers are going from uptown to downtown for work as this should be shown in a wider distribution in size with starting and ending location. This means that a wide array of epople are using these bikes who work ad live across the city.


## Additional Visuilizations

Two additional visualizations that could be made are:
1. Breaking down average location to pick up the bikes and location to drop off the bikes during rush hour. this could show if the bikes are being used for comuting, as averagng the out across the date and city shows no trned, but perhaps by time of day this could prove these bikes are being used for predominelty commuting purposes.

2.Average rides by gender and age group to determine the mix of riders and their demographic.
