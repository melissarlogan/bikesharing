# Bikesharing

## Overview
The below analysis has been performed on information from the New York City bike sharing program to determine if this program could be successful in other cities specifically Des Moines.

## Results

### Checkout Time for Users

The below shows, by number of trips, how long each trip lasts. Majority of trips taken are less than one hour with the largest concentration around ~30 minutes. Longer trips are less popular in general with these bikes.

### Checkout Time for Users by Gender
When breaking out the same data as above across male, female, and unknown genders, the same overall trend reigns true, shorter trips are more popular.  It is shown that males use the service more, but both males and females who use the service use it in a similar fashion.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour

The below graphic details the time of day when riding is more popular. There are high concentrations around 6am-9am along with 5pm-7pm which aligns with the average workday "rush hours"

### Trips by Weekday per Hour by Gender

Breaking the same graphic above out by gender shows again that males are using this service more frequently than females.  The same trend exists for using the bikes around rush hour times.

### Trips by Weekday by Gender and User Type

When breaking down trips by subscribers or not, the same trend follows suit with males using the service more often than females.  There is a consistent dip in usage on Wednesdays and Weekends compared to the other days of the week.

### Starting Locations
When looking at starting locations, they are spread out across the city with some areas more popular than others, but those popular areas are fairly spread out across the city

### Ending Locations
The same can be said for ending locations detailed below as they behave similarly to Starting Locations

## Summary

Overall, we can see that the Citi bikes are very popular in New York predominantly for men. These bikes when being used are used mostly during the rush hour commute suggesting they are used as a means of getting to work. It is also noted by looking at the starting and ending locations however that not all New Yorkers are going from uptown to downtown for work as this should be shown in a wider distribution in size with starting and ending location. This means that a wide array of people are using these bikes who work and live across the city.

## Additional Visualizations

Two additional visualizations that could be made are:
1. Breaking down average location to pick up the bikes and location to drop off the bikes during rush hour. This could show if the bikes are being used for commuting, as averaging the pickup and drop off locations across the city shows no trend, but perhaps by time of day this could prove these bikes are being used for predominantly commuting purposes.
2.Average rides by gender and age group to determine the mix of riders and their demographic.
